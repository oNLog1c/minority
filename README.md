# Description
**Minority** is a functional library for fast and modern Bukkit plugin development, which provides simple but powerful API for **automatically generating configurations and language files**. Everything works with the help of **annotations** and **reflection**. Working with configs (especially custom ones), as well as supporting different languages ​​for a programmer, has always been a living hell. This will be especially understood by those who have developed more or less complex plugins more than once. With **Minority**, this becomes a much easier task, which, suddenly, can even be enjoyable in its simplicity.
